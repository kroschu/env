### 1. Determine the owner of the process.

In order to determine the real owners of the processes, it is necessary:

* know exactly what they are doing
* vibrators of the owner for the process of skin 
* to achieve from each of the owners of the processes reporting and commenting of the steps in the process

##### Selection criteria for process owner

* Responsible for most of the steps in the top-level process map
* Responsible for process orientation and improvement
* Respect and influence in the organization
* Sees this work as one of its most important goals
* Continues to monitor and improve this process after the initial project

### 2. Vinachem responsible for the project optimization process ()

The project no (s) for the process (- cesam)_

* Articulates a vision of the process and its value to the enterprise
* Sets the boundaries and purpose of the process improvements
* Receives approval of his vision and purposes of the improvements from the head of the responsible
* Identifies and appoints the process owner and all project team members

Sushestvuet support the work of the current projects _

* Reports periodically on the progress of the project (s) to the responsible Manager 
* Helps to identify baseline measures and indicators for evaluation
* Discusses and helps solve issues and problems that process owners or team members have. Helps in solving interpersonal "human" problems.
* Decides on proposals for changes

_results and implementation_

* Responsible for the achievement of the intended result of the success of the whole initiative

* Provides protection for ways to improve processes at the second meeting with the leaders, and accepted proves recommendations to project teams
* Ensures continuity of success from project to project
* Regularly monitors the results of the implementation of process improvements (- villages)
* Proposes measures in case of identification for problem areas

### 3. Define the roles of project team members

I propose the following roles: Manager of projects, process owner, and a few team members in various disciplines:![](http://old.bpms.ru/fileadmin/articles/1_2013/BPM_G_S.jpg)Eksperty subject area_

The team should have 2-6 subject matter experts in addition to the process owner. The quantity depends on the complexity of the process and the size of the company. Subject matter experts should be the best (not just someone who is available), eager, and improve the process. It's good to have one member saying " no "in the group, but with such a few "nihilists" moving forward will be difficult.

Inakodumets_

Dissenter asks provocative questions, offers other views, to disagree with statements such as "we've always done it". Dissident to make a fresh look from the outside to improve the process. A good candidate for the role nakaguma maybe someone from another of the production Department, or who works in a related process, but not in this. The most important criterion for the dissident is the ability to think differently and ask questions. In the beginning, the dissident studies how the process works today and asks, " Why do we do it this way?"or "what if we consider this?»

_ Information technology specialists _

They are usually not developers, but business analysts, business architects who know the existing systems and can offer ideas for technical improvement of processes. Usually information technology specialists like to be in a team. They see the whole process and can make the most valuable suggestions to improve it. They help the team understand what is easy to do, what requires development and time-consuming, bring ideas and reality to the discussions about what current technologies allow and what will be possible in the future.

_ Specialist responsible for data_

The person in charge of the data just has to love the data and talk about where quantitative data can be useful. This person doesn't have to collect all the data and analyze it himself, rather, he just raises questions about the data in front of the team. It is important that this person knows about the process as much as necessary to understand what process information is needed.

Clerk_

This team member documents all ideas expressed at meetings, action items, decisions, process models for current and future use. It is most effective to have someone in the team who collects all the laptop process diagrams, while the team draws on the Board or on paper. But this can be documented after meetings.

Zakazchik or responsible head (optional)_

The customer is the one who decides to use the result of the BPM process. It is ideal to have a customer in each team, but it is not always convenient because of the workload.

These roles, taken together, make up a team that can see and understand different perspectives in the modeling, analysis and embedded process. Together they will give a synergistic effect and create a better result than alone. Companies Sometimes decide to engage an external consultant or business analyst, interview Yue subject matter experts individually. The consultant can summarize the information, but he will spend more time and the result will be weaker than the team will give in a few sessions. This combination of team members ensures strong effective development and process contributes to successful change management and implementation success.
