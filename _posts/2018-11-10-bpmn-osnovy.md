![Brief description of BPMN][1]

Of those, what is BPMN, it is written very much. But the problem is that almost all of the information that can be found on the Internet is targeted at people who have previously encountered BPMN or another business process modeling standard. I suggest to understand "from scratch" - what is BPMN? What are the features and benefits of this technology and why it is the connection was not so popular, at least abroad. Yes, and in our country it is more and more interested.

I also want to draw your attention to the fact that here I will talk about notation in BPMN, that is, the language of business process modeling. I, of course, will try as simply as possible to describe the basics of the graph so that they were clear even to beginners. But it's also important to understand that this is where I'm going to talk about language, not methodology.

The methodology of business process modeling is a very broad concept, in fact, it is the very base, knowledge of which is necessary for the practical application of business process modeling languages. I will talk about it in future articles more than once. Why do I put emphasis on this? A lot of people (at the time and I) believe that it is enough to study business modeling language, and you will be able to build business processes.

Practice shows that without basic knowledge can not do. And anyone who is just planning to study modeling, I strongly advise you to first get acquainted with the methodology, understand the General principles of business modeling, get some business analysis skills. And only then begin to study in BPMN or any other language.

And to understand the reasons for the appearance of BPMN and all the nuances of modeling with this system of notations, you will also need knowledge of the main problems that BPMN solves, that used to work before the appearance in BPMN, and what difficulties encountered. After all, the emergence of new systems of notation is impossible without understanding certain issues. And I think that this aspect is very important for understanding the essence of the question, what is actually in BPMN.

Personally I met for the first time in BPMN about eight years ago when I started to study Bizagi system Modeler. I became interested in this system because I have long understood the importance of modeling. Before that, I personally used IDEF0 IDEF3, but there I was faced with certain restrictions. The fact is that several IDEF0 is limited in the number of possibilities. And IDEF3 personally seemed to me too strict and "dry", it was difficult to simulate many types of business processes involving software products.

At that time, Bizagi was a relatively simple module that had a convenient editor for modeling (drawing) business processes, but there were no tools to execute business processes. But even then strict rules of BPMN adopted in the system, Bizagi, helped a significant number of errors, the beauties, such as the usual "draw" business processes in graphical editors or on paper.
