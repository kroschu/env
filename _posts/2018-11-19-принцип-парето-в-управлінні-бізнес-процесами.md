Economist and sociologist Wilfredo Pareto became famous for his rule of thumb, which in General sounds like this:"20% of the efforts give 80% of the result, and the remaining 80% of the efforts — only 20% of the result."

On the basis of this rule many analogies are built:

"20% of clients bring 80% of profit»

Or " 20% of men drink 80% of beer» :)

How to apply the Pareto principle in business process management?

Often the head of the company, interested in the idea of process management, comes to his employees with a new vision: we need to formalize our business processes. Trainings are held, consultants are involved or a staff of business analysts is hired, the work is in full swing. At first, ordinary employees and line managers take part in working groups with interest, interviews are conducted, models of processes are built, instructions are written. But after a couple of months, the interest disappears, the operating activity is addictive, and the end result is becoming less tangible. Sooner or later, the project ends. As a result, the company receives a set of regulations and business process models, but often after the completion of the project, the company's activities will not undergo major changes. Moreover, after 3-4 months the managers understand that the regulations are becoming outdated, as the processes by their nature begin to change. Top management has a feeling that the investment does not correspond to the result.

What to do to get a tangible return on investment in business process management?

Let me remind you that business processes are a tool for achieving strategic goals. Applying the Pareto principle, the following statement can be formulated: 20% of business processes give 80% of the contribution to the achievement of the company's strategic goals.

Therefore, it makes sense at the first stage to focus all forces, attention and resources on 3-5 key processes for the organization and run a cycle of process management (modeling, analysis, optimization, transformation, measurement, control) for them.

An additional advantage of this focus is the ability to get results in 2.5-3 months after the start of the project. This is important!  After all, any person can work with interest on any issue without receiving positive feedback for a short period of time, then his interest begins to fade. After receiving the first results, you can start polishing the business process in short iterations.

Therefore, the use of Pareto principle in business process management means that first of all you need to focus on the most critical processes to achieve strategic goals, leaving for later, perhaps problematic, but not key business processes.
