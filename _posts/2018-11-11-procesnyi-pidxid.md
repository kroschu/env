The company is a system within which there are many interrelated processes that determine the state of its functioning of the entire organizational system. ** Process approach** - is the consideration of the entire activity of the enterprise as a set of interacting processes occurring within the organizational structure of the enterprise and realize the purpose of its existence. World experience shows that the dynamic development of the market of goods and services, constant changes in the external environment and the growth of competition necessitate the search for new tools and methods of enterprise management.

The modern external environment of enterprises is characterized by an extremely high level of complexity, variability and uncertainty. In such circumstances, the main task of the company is to respond quickly to changes and the introduction of appropriate measures in the organization and implementation of production activities.

That is why the functioning of Ukrainian enterprises is marked by the need to apply a process approach to their management.

To address these issues, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the essence of the process approach to management, especially the business processes of the enterprise and ways to improve them.

<!--- excerpt-break-->

Most enterprises today are built on the functional principle and levels of hierarchy. Such an approach was laid down by Taylor and its development during the last century led to the spread of functional organizational structures of enterprise management. The widespread use of functional management structures, however, poses significant challenges to effective management. The functional units of the enterprise are relatively separate, do not always systematically understand the processes of functioning of the entire organization and are not interested in what does not directly concern them. Communication between the various functional units is often significantly hampered by an excessive tendency to bureaucratic rules of communication up the hierarchy levels.

This approach is typical for the organization of labor in the Soviet enterprises, the descendants of which have a large share of modern companies in my country, that in Western companies-mostly dry, difficult to understand text instructions that relate primarily to the functional approach:

1. Workplace description

2. Employee job description

3. Safety requirements, etc.

All this, as many remember, is extremely difficult to perceive, and a significant part of these instructions were dusting on the shelves, often, no one but the Creator, not read. And experience and requirements were transferred from the skilled employee to the beginner.

And what if there is a need to quickly change the work of the whole organization? And if at the same time introduced automation? Answers to these requests and was the emergence of BPM (Business Process Management, BPM), BPMN (_Business Process Model and Notation_), BPMS (Business Process Management System) and an appropriate approach to the organization and management of production based on them.

> * BPM is a methodology. that is, a set of basic principles and approaches to the construction of notations and the organization of work with the help of business processes.
> * BPMN-notation (language), in which notations are built, including those performed
> * BPMS-it execution system built according to certain rules specified in the methodology.
>
> If we draw an analogy with science, BPM is primarily an approach, a kind of worldview. BPMN are methods and algorithms for solving specific problems in the form of a model, using the same name record describes, for example, proofs of theorems, or a set of methods for creating a project to provide electricity to a production facility . And, in turn, BPMS is ready-made application solutions that can be "turned on" and they will already work. For mathematics, these are ready-made solutions to problems of practical importance. For physics-direct implementation of the same wiring and connection of objects. For the sphere of it â€” ready program code.

Business process management is what you regulate, describe, and change business processes. It is changing, not improving, because you can both improve and worsen the business process. Unlike a machine or a car, it is not possible to directly control a team by means of directives or by pressing a button. But you can set the sequence of actions that the team will perform when solving a particular task. This is what is called BPM.

If compressed the:

> Business process management (BPM) is the management of activities (automated and manual) in a team through business processes.

To manage any business processes you need:

1\. Describe the business processes themselves.

2\. Implement the described business process into the work of the team.

3\. Assign people responsible for business processes, so-called stack-holders or owners of business processes.

** Describe the business process* * it is necessary to understand well what it is for the enterprise.

The process in General is a consistent change of objects and phenomena, the States of the object in time, a set of sequential actions aimed at achieving a certain result. Therefore, the key features of the process in General and the business process in particular, should be considered a change in the state of the object and focus on a certain result.

Business processes of the enterprise include a wide range of processes different in nature, which explains the lack of a well-established definition of the business process. Currently, there are many definitions of the concept of business process, which describe the business process from different points of view.

All definitions are United primarily by the emphasis on the fact that business processes are continuous, have certain inputs (supply of resources, the emergence of new product ideas, services, etc.) and outputs in the form of a product that meets the needs of consumers.

In my opinion, the business process is a planned algorithm of interrelated actions or work flows, which is subject to systematic changes under the influence of external and internal factors, which involves all the resources of the organization, aimed at meeting customer demand and maximizing profits. This process has a beginning (input), a certain number of stages of activity and the result of the work that is obtained at the output.

Not every process that is carried out in the enterprise can be called a business process, even if this process leads to the creation of a product of value to the end user. A distinctive feature of the business process is its business orientation, that is, it reflects a certain direction of economic activity, the result of which is profit. The production activity of the enterprise, the purpose of which is the sale of the produced product, is a business process, if as a result of the sale of the manufactured products the enterprise will make a profit, since the purpose of creating any commercial enterprise is to make a profit. So, the business process is a set of activities of the enterprise, which will result in profit.

The main business processes are those focused on the production of products or the provision of services that are of value to the customer and provide income for the enterprise. As a rule, the main business processes at the enterprise are relatively few.

Supporting business processes are supporting processes that are designed to support the execution of core business processes. In General, they provide resources and services to all business processes of the enterprise.

Management business processes are business processes that cover the full range of management functions at the level of each business process and the business system as a whole.

Business processes of development-business processes of improvement, development of new directions and technologies, as well as innovations.

Allocation and classification of business processes of a particular enterprise, the definition of their parameters-a complex task that must be performed in the implementation of the process approach to the organization and management of the enterprise. To do this, the 5W1H method can be applied, which consists in a comprehensive description of the key business processes of the enterprise.

** Introduce a business process into the work of the team**, you must first prove its advantage, in comparison with the existing state of Affairs, greater financial efficiency, other significant advantages. For each specific business process, you need to perform your own justification, but, in General, the introduction of a process approach to the organization and management, allows the company to obtain the following benefits:

- creating conditions for broad delegation of authority and responsibility to the performers, which contributes to the quality of products and processes;

- each employee of the company is tied to the final result and is responsible for its quality;

- the main criterion of quality and value of products is to meet the needs of consumers;

- reduces the number of levels of decision-making, resulting in increased efficiency and adaptability of the enterprise;

- eliminates unnecessary costs that do not affect the value creation process;

- communication is improved, as information is exchanged within the working group of the business process, which eliminates its distortion, and significantly reduces the time of information transfer from one subject of the business process to another;

- conditions are created for automation of technologies of business processes.

One of the methods of describing business processes and technology of business organization based on the process approach and corporate information systems is the Workflow method. The term Workflow literally means "workflow". However, Workflow technology is considered much more widely-as automation of business processes of the enterprise, which is part of the BPM business process management concept.

Workflow (according to the Glossary of Workflow Management Coalition), an international organization engaged in the introduction of standards in Workflow systems) is an ordered set of work orders received and performed by employees using mechanization, automation, or manually, but in those sequences and within the framework of those rules that are defined for this business process.

The emergence of Workflow technology in the world was the result of a gradual transition from a functionally-oriented organization to a process-oriented one. At the same time, the focus is not so much on individual business functions as on the process itself. As the world practice has already shown, the introduction of such technology significantly reduces the duration of working cycles and allows to minimize the reaction time to customer requests and to change the situation in the market.

Today, Workflow technology is considered as the basis of the business organization model and corporate information systems of the XXI century. This technology is the best suited to the domestic business environment, the main of which is the unpredictability of the market and the environment.

The use of Workflow technology allows the company to obtain a number of competitive advantages, in particular:

- continuous change control and management, which allows the company to become a more dynamic structure in which changes are made by consistently adapting successful experience;

- allows you to manage the quality of both products and workflow and eliminate unnecessary costs;

- provides a continuous constant exchange of information by automating the processes of information transfer and the presence of constant and objective feedback within the organization.

- the company's management provides the information necessary to effectively intervene in the management process, to make decisions at the right time;

- provides effective support for decision-making, which affects the efficiency of the enterprise as a whole;

- allows you to identify hidden problems (which in other cases would have been ignored), which may be in the wrong organization of the business process;

- enables communication between technology and people by organizing all major components of the business process-roles, rules, routes, data, documents, applications and communications;

- using the Internet provides an opportunity to manage the process both inside and outside the enterprise, actively interacting with customers, suppliers and partners;

- enhances control over the performance of tasks related to information processing;

- provides enterprise analysts with statistics to analyze workloads, costs, peak periods and many other aspects of activity;

- allows you to model procedures and possible scenarios of their implementation with a high degree of detail and accuracy, while access to data on the implementation of processes requires minimal cost.

Thus, Workflow as a technology of effective management and monitoring of business processes is necessary for domestic enterprises, for which its implementation means streamlining, bringing it into clear procedures and significantly improving the efficiency of activities.

In modern conditions of the changing business environment, enterprises, the organizational structure of which is based on functional and hierarchical principles, are not able to provide adequate rapid response to fleeting changes and the introduction of appropriate measures in the organization and implementation of business activities. Under such business conditions, a process approach to management, which is one of the few ways for an enterprise to remain competitive, should be considered more effective. That is why the functioning of modern enterprises are marked by the need to apply a process approach to their management.

The main object of the process approach to management is a business process, which is a planned algorithm of interrelated actions or work flows, which is subject to systematic changes under the influence of factors of the external and internal environment, which involves all the resources of the organization, aimed at meeting the demand of consumers and maximizing profits. This process has a beginning (input), a certain number of stages of activity and the result of the work that is obtained at the output. An enterprise can have many different business processes, which are grouped into the following large groups: basic, support, management and business development processes.

One of the modern methods of description of business processes and technology of business organization and corporate information systems Workflow, the introduction of which at domestic enterprises and global corporations in modern conditions will streamline activities, improve the efficiency of their economic activities.
